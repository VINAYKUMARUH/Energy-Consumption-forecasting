Energy Consumption Forecasting Using XGBoostRegressor

Overview
This project aims to forecast energy consumption using historical data and machine learning. By leveraging the power of XGBoostRegressor, we model temporal patterns in energy usage to predict future consumption.

Features
Time-series forecasting using machine learning.
Preprocessing of date-based data to extract meaningful patterns.
Creation of lag features to capture temporal dependencies.
Training and testing of a robust XGBoost model for regression.
Scalable predictions for future energy usage.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas (data manipulation)
Numpy (numerical operations)
XGBoost (machine learning model)
Scikit-learn (preprocessing and evaluation)
Matplotlib (visualization)
